# Logic-Gates-With-Single-Layer-Perceptron
This repository contains a python code modeling four logic gates using a neural network with one neuron (single-layer perceptron).
>**Used modules:**
>1. numpy (for creating arrays and performing mathematical operations on them).
>2. random (for generating random values for the network weights during initialization).
>3. matplotlib (for plotting input cases and decision boundary to ensure the correct classification of the output).

The programs asks the user to enter a number representing a logic gate. Then, it calculates the correct values for the network weights. Finally, it plots the
final values of the weights and the decision boundary according to the chosen logic gate.
